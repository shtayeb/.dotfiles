-- You can add your own plugins here or in other files in this directory!
--  I promise not to create any merge conflicts in this directory :)

return {
	-- My plugins
	-- {
	-- 	dir = "~/Code/django-projects/nvim-django-shell",
	-- 	opts = {},
	-- },
	-- NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
	{ "tpope/vim-sleuth" }, -- Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run lua code when they are loaded.
	--
	-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
	-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
	--
	-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
	--  event = 'VimEnter'
	--
	-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
	-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
	--
	-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
	-- after the plugin has been loaded:
	--  config = function() ... end
	--
	-- The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
	-- init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
	-- put them in the right spots if you want.

	-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
	-- with the first argument being the link and the following
	-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
	--
	-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
	--
	--  This is equivalent to:
	--    require('Comment').setup({})

	-- "gc" to comment visual regions/lines
	{ "numToStr/Comment.nvim", opts = {} },
	-- Highlight todo, notes, etc in comments
	{
		"folke/todo-comments.nvim",
		event = "VimEnter",
		dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
		opts = { signs = true },
	},

	{
		"olexsmir/gopher.nvim",
		ft = "go",
		config = function(_, opts)
			require("gopher").setup(opts)
			vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ee", "<cmd>GoIfErr<CR>")
		end,
		build = function()
			vim.cmd.GoInstallDeps()
		end,
